# `tasks`: task lists and planning
Our task management here is radically minimalistic. There are only two files and no external software is used:

|file|description|
|----|-----------|
|`agile.txt`|keeps track of the (general) project direction (i.e. version goals)|
|`jira.txt`|list of all non-trivial tasks|

In `jira.txt`, we adopt a simple convention and mark tasks as
- `[ ]`: not started;
- `[\]`: in progress;
- `[x]`: finished.

Try to (roughly) order tasks by importance. No need for elaborate metrics or due dates. Finished tasks go to the bottom of the file.
